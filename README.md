# Yolo_Algorithm
Experimenting and exploring the use of the yolo algorithm for detecting objects. 


To use either version of yolo, you first must download the yolo.weights file on https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet readme.


TODO:

- Make yolo detect objects that arent included in the coco_names file.
- Add quit button to terminate instead of ctrl+c
