# Yolo_Algorithm
Experimenting and exploring the use of the yolo algorithm when detecting objects. 

To use the YOLOv3 algorithm with opencv, 3 files should to be downloaded:

The first 2:

yolov3.cfg
yolov3.weights
From https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/

And the third:
https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/blob/master/data/coco.names


TODO:

- Make yolo detect objects that arent included in the coco_names file
- Get it to work on a video
